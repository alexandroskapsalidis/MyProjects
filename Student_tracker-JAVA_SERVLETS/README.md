This Java web application, built with Servlets, simulates a simple school management system that supports full Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality.

Upon launching, users can view a list of students and easily add, edit, or remove student records. After each operation, the updated student list is displayed, providing an interactive and seamless user experience.
