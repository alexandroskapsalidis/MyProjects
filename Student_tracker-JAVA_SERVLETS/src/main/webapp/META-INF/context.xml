<!-- 
   The context.xml is a small, Tomcat specific file that tells Tomcat how to connect
   to the database. And how to configure your pool, such as how many connections
   to create up front, the minimum number of connections etc. There is a context
   tag and inside it there is a resource reference in the middle. In there you give
   the name of the resource. This name is the alias we'll use later on in our
   application to look up this connection pool. On the next line we tell Tomcat how
   we're going to authenticate, auth="Container" means the Tomcat Server will handle
   the authentication. Next in type=... there is the name of the Java interface that
   we'll use for communicating with the pool. In the Java world the term "DataSource"
   means Connection Pool. Next we define the size of the connections. In the next three
   lines we tell Tomcat how to connect to the Database. username and password of the
   account we created, the fully qualified name of the JDBC driver, and finally the URL
   to the database. -->
