This Java console program controls two elevators in a 10-story building with a basement (floor -1) and a penthouse (floor 10). Elevator A serves all floors except the penthouse, while Elevator B operates on all floors except the basement. Users can call the elevators from their current location, select their desired floor once inside, and use stop and reset buttons as needed.
